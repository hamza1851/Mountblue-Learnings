Markdown is a set of syntax rules used while writing `.md` files in Git. 

Some basic commands:

* `#` for headings
* `##` for sub-headings
* `###` for h3 tags in HTML
* `** **` is used to make text bold
* `*** ***` is used to make text bold and itali
* `[dep](url)` links the word "dep" to a URL
* `---` is used to create a horizontal line
